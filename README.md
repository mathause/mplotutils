# mplotutils

helper functions for cartopy and matplotlib

This package solves two main problems for plots with maps created with cartopy. Because these plots have a fixed aspect ratio (1) colorbars will extend beyond the visible axes and (2) the distance between individual subplots will seemingly be random.

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## History

This package bases on functions developped for the [python visualisation workshop at C2SM](https://github.com/C2SM/pyvis/) (Part 3 -> `utils.py`).
`utils.py` in turn is based on [mutils](https://github.com/mathause/mutils).
